### February 20th, 2013

The aircooled VW community is pretty chill. There used to be a site that listed contact information of people willing to help out a travelling aircooled VW owner should there be a mishap on the road. The old site wasn't being maintained anymore, so I made my own. I scraped all the old info from the previous site, and made the new site accept registrations, rather than running each listing by the webmaster. Then all that info gets plotted on a map.
