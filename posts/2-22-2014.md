# Census Dataset Explorer
### February 22nd, 2014


I heard about the US Census API and was looking around inside it. There are thousands of cool datasets within a well executed API, but it's pretty hard to navigate through because of the scale. I thought it would be cool if there was a way to organize them and maybe  provide a simple visualization for each dataset. I created a thing called [Census Explorer](http://census-explorer.com) that attempts to do that. Hopefully it will make the datasets more accessible. Right now it consists of the SF1 and ACS5 datasets from the 2010 Census. 


I pretty much just dumped all the dataset descriptions into an Elastic Search index, and provided a simple api for getting at it. The web interface is intentionally minimal, as this is really just an experiment-weekend project. [The source lives here](http://github.com/rozap/census-explorer).
