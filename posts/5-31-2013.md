# [Load Testing using Digital Ocean](posts/5-31-2013.html)
### May 31st, 2013

The folks at the Chicago Tribune built a load testing utility called [Bees with Machine Guns](https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns) which is a nice little tool that starts a number of EC2 instances, then hits a URL a bunch of times, and then shuts everything down after generating a report. It's a cheap, easy, and realistic way to load test your site. I've been using Digital Ocean for a few months now, mostly because it's cheaper, but they also provide a nice API, so I modified bees with machine guns to run on digital ocean rather than AWS. The project is called [Minnows with machine guns.](https://github.com/rozap/minnowswithmachineguns)
