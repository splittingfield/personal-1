I don't even know how I came across aquaponics, but it seemed like something that would be fun to overcomplicate. Also fish are cool and basil is delicious. 

I built a little ebb and flow system that is controlled by raspberry pi. The pi controls the pump and the valve which it runs on a timer to fill and drain the grow beds. The pi also monitors pH via a pH sensor that runs on i2c. There's also a water temperature sensor that collects data. All the readings are displayed on a web page and graphed. 

Everything that runs the sensors and the web console is [here.](https://github.com/rozap/rpi_garden)
