<p>People have been sending a lot of good links over <a href="http://chat.meatspac.es">meatspaces</a>. There are a lot of good tunes, sites, etc sent, so I made <a href="http://meatlinks.hiiamchris.com">A simple Thing</a> to listen to the meatspace chat and save the links. The source is <a href="https://github.com/rozap/meatspace-links">here.</a>  </p>
<p>Update: Recently added a radio feature. The bot will pull out any soundcloud links or youtube music from the conversation and index it. If you click on the link in the top right of meatlinks, an embedded player will show up and will choose a random song to play, and then move onto the next. So it&#39;s a little shuffle based player that plays music that has previously been sent. Sometimes the category of a youtube song isn&#39;t set as &quot;music&quot; so to explicitly add a youtube link you can include &quot;musicbot&quot; in the meatspace message. </p>
