<p>A while back I had a small digital ocean instance running elastic search as part of an app. There was a big vulnerability in the dynamic scripting module that allowed arbitrary code execution. My instance got hacked, but it was around two months after the vulnerability disclosure, but I never heard about it.  </p>
<p>I was wanting to try out the Phoenix framework in Elixir at the time, so I put together a little app that monitors security disclosure lists and will notify you when a package in your application has a vulnerability. If your packages are managed through a package manager like apt, npm, pypi, or rubygems, then it&#39;s really simple to get notifications when there&#39;s a disclosure affecting you. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.vuln.pub">The site is called vuln.pub</a>. You can create a &quot;monitor&quot; which has a manifest describing the dependencies in your app. vuln.pub will periodically poll your manifest for changes in your packages and package versions. When a vulnerability comes in from a seclist, it will find all the packages you have installed, and if the version is vulnerable, send you a notification.</p>
<p>Elixir was surprisingly pleasant, much more so than node. I think I&#39;ll be writing a lot of stuff in the future with it. </p>
