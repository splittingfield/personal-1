<p>Thought it would be interesting to visualize the connections of Hubski in a different way. Though the graph should be directed, I wanted to keep it simple, so right now it’s undirected. Size represents the number of followers someone has. Let it settle for a couple seconds, then click the “Stop Layout” button. You can zoom with your mouse wheel. Mouse over a user to eliminate all users that aren’t directly following or followed by them.</p>
