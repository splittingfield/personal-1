<p>I wanted to put a bunch of LEDs in the ceiling of the 73 VW bus I have. I finally put the arduino to use in this project. The arduino controls some (4) TLC5940 LED drivers, and an Android through an app I wrote communicates with the arduino via serial bluetooth adapter. There are 64 LEDs and each is addressable individually, and can be faded on or off. It&#39;s pretty basic but it was the most elegant way I could think of lighting up the inside of the bus. The end result was something I&#39;m pretty happy with...it works well and looks pretty cool. </p>

<p>I also wrote some stuff to measure the cylinder head temperature on the engine via the stock fuel injection temperature sensor. The temperature sensor is just a resistor that changes its resitance as the engine heats up. I found the following graph on Ratwell&#39;s site and then fit it to get a function to convert the resistance to a temperature. The temperature displays on the phone app. In the future I&#39;m going to be measuring the main and aux battery voltages, as well as the RPM via hall sensor.  </p>

<p>In the future I might ditch the arduino for something faster like a raspberry pi, as there are some pretty annoying performance issues with generating tons of serial interrupts. However, the arduino is neat because it&#39;s very low power. </p>
<p>The stuff used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arduino mega</li>
<li>Android Phone or Tablet</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/BT2S-Bluetooth-to-Serial-Slave/dp/B006RBK9ZW/ref=pd_sim_indust_1">Bluetooth module</a></li>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/">Tlc5940 arduino lib</a></li>
<li>4x Tlc5940&#39;s</li>
<li>and some miscellaneous resistors, regulators, etc. </li>
